[`patter`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/patter) is [R](https://www.r-project.org) package implementation of the [`flapper`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/flapper) family of algorithms for passive acoustic telemetry (Lavender et al., 2023). This evolved from the experimental [`flapper`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/flapper) package, but is simpler, faster and better tested. 

# Key features

Building on its [predecessor](https://github.com/edwardlavender/flapper), [`patter`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/patter) has been designed to be:

* **Simpler** to use and maintain;
* **More streamlined**, with fewer functions and function arguments that are better tested;
* **More stable**, with fewer dependencies and an upgraded spatial ecosystem;
* **Faster**, with revised internal routines that exploit the [`data.table`](https://github.com/Rdatatable/data.table) and [`terra`](https://github.com/rspatial/terra) packages and substantive, new algorithm parameterisations; 
* **Better tested**, with comprehensive unit tests; 

At the time of writing (September 2023),[ `patter`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/patter) solely provides the functions required to implement the [`flapper`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/flapper) family of algorithms, which represent a subset of the capacity provided by [`flapper`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/flapper). Further developments will be driven by user requirements. Please get in touch if you would like to see additional functionality brought into [`patter`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/patter). 

# Installation 

This package requires `R` version ≥ 4.0. You can check your current version with `R.version.string`. Subsequent installation steps (may) require the `devtools` and `pkgbuild` packages, which can be installed with `install.packages(c("devtools", "pkgbuild"))`. On Windows, package building requires `Rtools`. You can check whether `Rtools` is installed with `pkgbuild::has_rtools()`. If `Rtools` is not installed, it is necessary to download and install the appropriate version of `Rtools` before proceeding by following the instructions [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Once you are set up, you can install [`patter`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/patter) via: 

``` r
devtools::install_github("edwardlavender/patter", 
                         dependencies = TRUE, 
                         build_vignettes = TRUE)
```

The `dependencies = TRUE` argument ensures that suggested packages are also installed, which are required for some functions and to build vignettes. To access the introductory vignette, use `vignette("patter_introduction", package = "patter")`.

# Datasets

For example datasets, see:

* `dat_moorings` for receiver locations and associated information;
* `dat_acoustics` for acoustic time series;
* `dat_archival` for archival (depth) time series;
* `dat_gebco()` for a bathymetry grid;

# Workflow

To implement the depth-contour algorithm, use:

* `dc_setup_model()` for an example DC model;
* `dc()` to implement the algorithm;

To implement the AC* algorithms, use:

* `acs_setup_obs()` to set up observations;
* `acs_setup_detection_containers()` to set up detection containers;
* `acs_setup_detection_overlaps()` to set up detection overlaps;
* `acs_setup_detection_kernels()` to set up detection kernels;
* `acs()` to implement the algorithm(s);
 
To implement particle filtering, use:
 
* `pf_setup_record()` to set up the record;
* `pf_kick()` for an example movement model;
* `pf_forward()` to implement the forward simulation;
* `pf_backward()` to implement the backward path'
* `pf_pou()` to map probability-of-use;
* `pf_path()` (and `pf_path_pivot()`) to reconstruct movement paths;
 
For home ranges, use:

* `get_hr_prop()` for a custom range;
* `get_hr_core()` for the 'core' range;
* `get_hr_home()` for the 'home' range;
* `get_hr_full()` for the full range;
 
For supporting functions, see `help(package = 'patter')`:

  * `make_matrix_receivers()` matricises receiver deployment time series;
  * `normalise()` normalises a `SpatRaster`;
  * `cl_*()` functions for parallelisation helpers;
 
# Disclaimer and troubleshooting 

[`patter`](https://github.com/edwardlavender/patter) is a new [R](https://www.r-project.org/) package. All routines are experimental. Researchers interested in using the package are encouraged to get in touch while the methods and package remain at an early stage of evolution (edward.lavender@eawag.ch).
