\description{
These are sample datasets collated by the Movement Ecology of Flapper Skate (MEFS) project (Lavender, 2022). The flapper skate (\emph{Dipturus intermedius}) is a Critically Endangered benthic elasmobranch. As part of the MEFS project, flapper skate were tagged with acoustic transmitters and archival (data storage) tags off the west coast of Scotland in 2016--17. Acoustic transmissions were recorded at an array of passive acoustic telemetry receivers. Concurrent depth time series were recorded by archival tags and recovered from recaptured individuals. For full details, see the references below. The datasets are defined within \code{\link{patter}} to illustrate package functions using real-world datasets.

\section{Moorings}{
\code{\link{dat_moorings}} defines passive acoustic telemetry receiver locations and associated information. This includes the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{receiver_id}---an \code{integer} vector that defines unique receiver deployments;
\item \code{receiver_start}, \code{receiver_end}---\code{Date} vectors that define receiver deployment start and end dates;
\item \code{receiver_x}, \code{receiver_y}---\code{numeric} vectors that define receiver coordinates (in UTM 29N);
\item \code{receiver_alpha}, \code{receiver_beta}, \code{receiver_gamma}---a \code{numeric} vectors that define detection probability parameters;
}

Data are arranged by \code{receiver_id}.
}

\section{Acoustics}{
\code{\link{dat_acoustics}} contains sample detection time series. This includes the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{individual_id}---an \code{integer} vector that identifies individuals;
\item \code{timestamp}---a \code{POSIXct} vector that defines the time of each observation;
\item \code{receiver_id}---the receiver ID (see \code{\link{dat_moorings}});
}

Data are arranged by \code{individual_id}, \code{timestamp} and then \code{receiver_id}.
}

\section{Archival}{
\code{\link{dat_archival}} contains sample depth time series. Observations were sampled every 2 minutes. The data includes the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{individual_id}---an \code{integer} vector that identifies individuals (as in \code{\link{dat_acoustics}});
\item \code{timestamp}---a \code{POSIXct} vector that defines the time of each observation;
\item \code{depth}---a \code{numeric} vector that defines the depth (m) of the individual at each time step;
}

Data are arranged by \code{individual_id} and then \code{timestamp}.
}

\section{Bathymetry}{
\code{\link[=dat_gebco]{dat_gebco()}} returns a bathymetry (m) dataset for the west coast of Scotland where MEFS data were collected. This dataset is a \code{\link{SpatRaster}} with the following properties:
\itemize{
\item \code{dimensions}---264, 190, 1 (\code{nrow}, \code{ncol}, \code{nlyr});
\item \code{resolution}---100, 100  (\code{x}, \code{y});
\item \code{extent}---695492.1, 714492.1, 6246657, 6273057  (\code{xmin}, \code{xmax}, \code{ymin}, \code{ymax});
\item \verb{coord. ref.}---WGS 84 / UTM zone 29N (EPSG:32629);
}
