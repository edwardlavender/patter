Description: Particle filters, smoothers and sampling algorithms for animal movement modelling, with a focus on passive acoustic telemetry systems. This methodology enables the reconstruction of movement paths and patterns of space use. The methodology unifies a suite of methods formerly known as the flapper algorithms and supersedes the {flapper} package.
